Grow your own perls. A development environment for hacking perl based on vagrant

Installation
------------

Make sure you have installed vagrant and virtualbox and you have this repo checked out locally (it uses git submodules, so tarballs aren't much good). Run these commands:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
vagrant up
```

Et voila!
